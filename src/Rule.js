     * Return the type of this rule. Rules can be organized into the following

     *
     * - A resource rule. This checks a translated resource with a source string
     *   and a translation to a given locale. eg. a rule that checks that
     *   substitution parameters that exist in the source string also are
     *   given in the target string.
     * - A line rule. This rule checks single lines of a file. eg. a rule to
     *   check the parameters to a function call.
     * - A multiline rule. This rule checks multiple lines at once to find
     *   problems that may span multiple lines. For example, a rule to enforce
     *   a policy that all translatable strings in a source file have an appropriate
     *   translator's comment on them.
     * - A multifile rule. This rule checks problems across multiple files. eg.
     *   a rule to check that ids for translatable strings are unique across all
     *   files.
     *
     * @returns {String} a string with either "resource", "line", "multiline", or
     * "multifile".

    /**
     * Return whether or not this rule matches the input. The options object can
     * contain any of the following properties:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>locale - the locale against which this rule should be checked. Some rules
     * are locale-sensitive, others not.
     * <li>resource - the resource to test this rule against. For resource rules, this
     * is a required property. 
     * <li>line - a single line of a file to test this rule against (for line rules)
     * <li>lines - all the lines of a file to test this rule against (for multiline rules
     * and multifile rules)
     * <li>pathName - the name of the current file being matched in multifile rules. 
     * <li>parameters - (optional) parameters for this rule from the configuration file
     * </ul>
     *
     * The return value from this method when a rule matches is an object with the
     * following properties:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>severity - the severity of this match. This can be one of the following:
     *   <ul>
     *   <li>suggestion - a suggestion of a better way to do things. The current way is
     *   not incorrect, but probably not optimal
     *   <li>warning - a problem that should be fixed, but which does not prevent
     *   your app from operating internationally. This is more severe than a suggestion.
     *   <li>error - a problem that must be fixed. This type of problem will prevent
     *   your app from operating properly internationally and could possibly even
     *   crash your app in some cases.
     *   </ul>
     * <li>description - a description of the problem to display to the user. In order
     * to make the i18nlint output useful, this description should attempt to make the
     * following things clear:
     *   <ul>
     *   <li>What part is wrong
     *   <li>Why it is wrong
     *   <li>Suggestions on how to fix it
     *   </ul>
     * <li>lineNumber - the line number where the match occurred in multiline rules
     * <li>highlight - the line where the problem occurred, highlighted with XML syntax
     * (see below)
     * </ul>
     *
     * For the `highlight` property, the line that has a problem is reproduced with
     * XML tags around the problem part, if it is known. The tags are of the form
     * &lt;eX&gt; where X is a digit starting with 0 and progressing to 9 for each
     * subsequent problem. If the file type is XML already, the rest of the line will
     * be XML-escaped first.<p>
     * 
     * Example:<p>
     *
     * "const str = rb.getString(<e0>id</e0>);"<p>
     *
     * In this rule, `getString()` must be called with a static string in order for the
     * loctool to be able to extract that string. The line above calls `getString()`
     * with a variable named "id" as a parameter. The variable is highlighted with the
     * e0 tag. Callers can then translate the open and close tags appropriately for
     * the output device, such as ASCII escapes for a regular terminal, or HTML tags
     * for a web-based device.
     *
     * @param {Object} options The options object as per the description above
     * @returns {Object|Array.<Object>|=} an object describing the problem if the rule
     * does match for this locale, or an array of such Objects if there are multiple
     * problems with the same input, or undefined if the rule does not match

# ilib-lint

A static analysis linter for many types of source files that looks for i18n problems.

This i18n linter differs from other static linters in the following ways:

* it can recognize the locale of files from the path name of files or from within
  the file itself, and applies locale-sensitive rules. For example, you can apply
  a rule that checks that the translations in a resource file of a plural resource
  contain the correct set of plural categories for the target language.
* it can apply different rulesets to different sets of files. This is useful for
  a number of reasons:
    * when linting a mono-repo that has different subprojects inside of it
      and each subproject needs different rules applied to its files
    * when different file types need different rulesets

## Installation

```
npm install ilib-lint

or

yarn add ilib-lint
```

Then, in your package.json, add a script:

```
"scripts": {
    "lint": "ilib-lint"
}
```

Please note: nodejs version 14 or above is required to run this tool, as it
is written with ESM modules.

## Quick Start

Running ilib-lint is easy. Just change your directory to the top level directory
of your project and run it with no parameters and no configuration file. When
there are no parameters and no configuration file, it will do all default
behaviours, which for some projects is sufficient.

The default behaviours are:

* Start in the current directory and recursively find all files
  and subdirectories underneath there
* All built-in rules will be added to the current rule set
* There are a few built-in
  types of files handled and default rulesets that apply to them.
* For each rule in a ruleset, it will use the default settings for that rule
* It will use the default set of locales (the top 20 locales on the internet
  by traffic) with "en-US" being the source locale
* It will apply each rule in the current ruleset that applies to
  each type of file. If a file type does not have any rulesets that apply to it,
  it will be skipped.
    * the locale of a file will be gleaned from its path name if possible
    * for some types of resource files, the locale is documented in
      the file itself. (eg. xliff files)
* Output will be printed on the standard output in human readable form

## Command-line Parameters

ilib-lint accepts the following command-line parameters:

* help - Print out a help message detailing these command-line parameters
* config - Give an explicit path to a configuration file instead of trying to
  find it in the current directory.
* errorsOnly - Only give information on errors, not warnings. Also, only exit
  with status 2 if there are errors, and status 0 if there are warnings. This
  flag allows you to squelch the warnings and only fail a script if there are
  actual errors.
* locales - Locales you want your app to support. Value is a comma-separated
  list of BCP-47 style locale tags.
  Default: the top 20 locales on the internet by traffic.
* sourceLocale - locale of the source files or the source locale for resource
  files. Default: "en-US"
* quiet - Produce no progress output during the run, except for errors running
  the tool such as the inability to load a plugin. Instead exit with a return
  value. Zero indicates no errors, and a positive exit value indicates errors.

## Exit Status

If you want to use this linter in a script, you can check for the following
exit status:

* 0 - no problems found
* 1 - warnings found
* 2 - errors found

When the `--errorsOnly` flag is given, the program will return 0 if only
warnings can be found or if no issues are found.

## Configuration

If the named paths contain a file called `ilib-lint-config.json`, it
will be read and processed to configure the ilib-lint tool for that path. The
`ilib-lint-config.json` file can have any of the following properties:

* name (String) - name of this project
* locales (Array of strings) - that name the default set of locales for the
  whole project if they are not configured by each path
* sourceLocale (String) - name the locale for source strings in this app.
  Default if not specified is "en-US".
* paths (Object) - a set of configurations for various paths that are given
  by a [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) glob expression.
  Each glob expression property should be an object that contains settings
  that apply to files that match the glob expression. The settings can be
  be any of:
    * locales (Array of strings) - a set of locales that override
      the global locales list
    * rules - (Object) a set of rules to use with this set of files.
      Each rule name maps either to a boolean (true means turn it
      on, and false means off) or to a string or object that gives
      options for the rule. (Each rule can be different)
    * rulesets (Array of strings) - list the names of rule sets to
      turn on. Rulesets are groups of rules that are typically
      bundled together for particular purpose, such as rules for a
      particular library in a particular programming languages. For
      example, you might have a "android-kotlin" ruleset that turns
      on a number of rules that are typical for checking Android
      apps written in Kotlin. If a ruleset is given, the
      individual rules in that rule set can still be overridden using
      the "rules" property above. Rulesets are just a short-hand
      to turn on many of them at once.
    * template (string) - a template that can be used to parse the
      file name for the locale of that file.

The `ilib-lint-config.json` file can be written in [JSON5](https://github.com/json5/json5)
syntax, which means it can contain comments and other enhancements.

### Example Config File

Here is an example of a configuration file:

```json
{
    "name": "tester",
    "locales": [
        "en-US",
        "de-DE",
        "ja-JP",
        "ko-KR"
    ],
    "excludes": {
        "node_modules/**",
        ".git/**",
        "test/**"
    },
    "paths": {
        "src/**/*.json": {
            // override the general locales
            "locales": [
                "en-US",
                "de-DE",
                "ja-JP"
            ],
            "rulesets": [
                "javascript-ilib"
            ]
        },
        // check the translations from the translation vendor before
        // we use them in our project
        "**/*.xliff": {
            "rules": {
                "formatjs-plural-syntax": true,
                "formatjs-plural-categories": true,
                "formatjs-match-substitution-params": true,
                "match-quote-style": "localeOnly"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Built-in Rules

Some generic rules that apply to many types of files are built-in to ilib-lint.
This apply mostly to resource files, such as XLIFF files.

The built-in rules are:

- resource-icu-plurals - check for ICU-style plurals. Also works with formatjs
  plurals, as it has the same syntax.
- resource-quote-style - if the source string has quotes, check that the target
  string also has quotes and that those quotes are appropriate for the locale
- resource-url-match - if the source string contains references to URLs, check
  that the target string also contains references to the same URLs
- resource-named-params - Ensure that named parameters that appear in the source
  string are also used in the translated string
- resource-unique-key - Ensure that the keys are unique within a locale across
  all resource files
